# getting_an_interview(Flutter)

A new Flutter project made to get an interview for an internship.

## Description 

I made this very simple app , to send it to a CTO  in order to prove him 
that i would be able to deal with dart and flutter => language and framework that i never used before 

in few hours I have read the documentation and  produced 
this small code which have several features such as :
*  Routing navigation.
* Modal Bottom sheet
* use of basic stateless widgets (text,icons,buttons,app bar etc)
* Url_launcher to open external link => to reach my portfolio of course ^^
